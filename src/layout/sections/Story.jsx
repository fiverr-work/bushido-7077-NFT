        In the year <b>7077</b>, thousands of years after the glacial basin collapsed, evolution
        looms into a new era where hybrid species dominated the face of the Earth. Alpha Zero was
        appointed as the supreme authority and has absolute power over the land.
      </p>

        As the droids rise into a position of political strength, their insatiable thirst and greed
        to wield even greater power forced the cyborgs to turn against the confederation.
